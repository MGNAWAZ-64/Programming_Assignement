    "#Q1. What are the two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X?\n",
    "Ans: In Python 3.x, user-defined exceptions are custom exceptions created by inheriting from the base Exception class or any of its subclasses. Two important aspects of defining exceptions in Python 3.x are constraints that enhance how exceptions are defined and used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance from BaseException:\n",
    "User-defined exceptions must inherit from the BaseException class (typically through the Exception subclass).\n",
    "This inheritance ensures that the custom exception fits into the exception hierarchy and behaves as expected when raised or caught.\n",
    "Example Code:\n",
    "    class CustomException(Exception):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "2. Use of __init__() and __str__() for Custom Exception Messages:\n",
    "User-defined exceptions can include initialization (__init__) to accept additional arguments, and __str__() or __repr__() methods to define custom string representations of the exception message.\n",
    "The __init__() method allows passing specific information when the exception is raised, and __str__() defines how the exception message is displayed.\n",
    "Example Code:\n",
    "    class InvalidInputError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message, code):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        self.code = code\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Error {self.code}: {self.message}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Raising the custom exception\n",
    "raise InvalidInputError(\"Invalid input provided\", 400)\n",
    "\n",
    "These constraints ensure that user-defined exceptions are consistent with Python's error-handling mechanisms, providing meaningful and structured error information."

    "#Q2. How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:In Python, class-based exceptions that have been raised are matched to handlers using the inheritance hierarchy of exception classes. Here's how the matching process works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Raising an Exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised using the raise statement, Python searches for the nearest exception handler (except block) that matches the type of the exception.\n",
    "Handler Matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "The raised exception is matched against except clauses in the order they appear.\n",
    "Python checks each except clause sequentially to see if the raised exception matches the exception type specified in the except block.\n",
    "Matching by Class Hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python checks if the raised exception is an instance of the class specified in the except block or any of its parent classes.\n",
    "If the raised exception is an instance of the specified class or a subclass of it, the exception is considered a match, and that handler will be executed.\n",
    "If no matching handler is found in the current scope, the search continues up the call stack.\n",
    "Order of except Clauses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific exceptions should be listed before general ones (e.g., a specific subclass should be placed before its parent class).\n",
    "If a general exception (e.g., Exception) is placed before a more specific one, it will catch the exception first, making the more specific handler unreachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class SpecificError(CustomError):\n",

    "    # Raise a specific error\n",
    "    raise SpecificError(\"A specific error occurred.\")\n",

    "#Q3. Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artefacts.\n",
    "Ans: Here are two common methods for adding context information to exception artifacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using Exception Attributes (__init__() method)\n",
    "You can attach context information to exceptions by adding custom attributes through the __init__() method of your custom exception class. This allows you to store additional data directly within the exception object.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a custom exception class that inherits from Exception (or any other appropriate base exception class).\n",
    "Override the __init__() method to accept additional context parameters.\n",
    "Store these parameters as attributes of the exception object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class DatabaseError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message, query, user_id):\n",
    "        super().__init__(message)\n",
    "        self.query = query\n",
    "        self.user_id = user_id\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Simulate a database error\n",
    "    raise DatabaseError(\"Failed to execute query\", \"SELECT * FROM users\", 101)\n",

    "    print(f\"Query: {e.query}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"User ID: {e.user_id}\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Using the __cause__ and __context__ Attributes\n",
    "Python automatically attaches exceptions to __cause__ and __context__ attributes, allowing you to chain exceptions and preserve context when one exception leads to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "__cause__: Set explicitly using the raise ... from ... syntax, which indicates a direct causal relationship between exceptions.\n",
    "__context__: Automatically set when an exception occurs in the except block of another exception, capturing the original exception context.\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use raise ... from ... to attach a specific cause to an exception.\n",
    "The original exception will be stored in the __cause__ attribute of the new exception, while the default chaining will populate the __context__ attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Code: \n",
    "def parse_data(data):\n",
    "    try:\n",

    "Ans: Here are two common methods for defining error messages in custom exceptions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the __init__() Method with super() to Set the Error Message\n",
    "One of the most common ways to specify the error message of an exception is by passing the message to the __init__() method of the custom exception class. This message is then passed to the base Exception class using super().\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",

    "Define a custom exception class that inherits from Exception (or another relevant base class).\n",

    "Example Code:\n",

    "    print(e)  # Output: This is a custom error message.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Overriding the __str__() or __repr__() Method\n",
    "Another approach is to override the __str__() or __repr__() methods in the custom exception class to control how the exception message is displayed. This method allows for more complex formatting and inclusion of additional context directly in the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a custom exception class and override its __str__() or __repr__() method.\n",

    "#Q5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: String-based exceptions are no longer used in Python because they are considered outdated, less robust, and inconsistent with Python’s object-oriented design principles. String-based exceptions were used in very early versions of Python (prior to Python 1.5), where exceptions were represented simply as strings. Modern Python versions (Python 1.5 onwards) have moved towards using class-based exceptions due to several key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lack of Structure and Consistency:\n",
    "String-based exceptions provide no consistent structure, making it hard to categorize errors or define specific types of exceptions.\n",
    "With string-based exceptions, it's difficult to programmatically determine what kind of error has occurred, as you would have to match error messages manually, which is error-prone and unreliable.\n",
    "2. No Inheritance and Hierarchy:\n",
    "String exceptions do not support inheritance, which is a core feature of class-based exceptions. Class-based exceptions allow you to define a hierarchy of exceptions, making it easier to catch and handle errors based on their specificity or generality.\n",
    "This hierarchical structure helps in writing clean and maintainable code by allowing broader exceptions to catch multiple specific error types.\n",
    "3. Limited Error Handling Capabilities:\n",
    "String exceptions cannot encapsulate additional context or data beyond a simple message, limiting their usefulness in complex error handling scenarios.\n",
    "Class-based exceptions allow the inclusion of attributes and methods, enabling you to attach additional context, such as error codes, affected variables, or recovery suggestions, directly to the exception object.\n",
    "4. Poor Readability and Debugging:\n",
    "Handling string exceptions requires matching exact string content, which is prone to typos and inconsistencies. Debugging and maintaining code with string-based error messages can be tedious and unreliable.\n",
    "Class-based exceptions improve readability by using clear and descriptive class names, which make it obvious what type of error is being handled.\n",
    "5. Compatibility with the try-except Model:\n",
    "The try-except model in Python relies on class-based exceptions to match raised exceptions with the appropriate except block based on class inheritance. String-based exceptions do not fit into this model, as matching strings would require manual comparisons, complicating the exception handling process.        \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of String-Based vs. Class-Based Exception Handling:\n",
    "    String-based (Old Approach):\n",
    "        try:    \n",
    "            raise \"FileNotFoundError\"\n",
